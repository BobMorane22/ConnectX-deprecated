 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * <b> cXbase </b> is a library written in C++ that is intended to facilitate 
 * the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four"> 
 * Connect 4 applications and variations </a>. The library renders available 
 * classes and tools to create games with various grid dimensions, player 
 * count, etc.
 *
 * @section parametrizations Possible parametrizations
 *
 * The following items of a classic Connect 4 game are customizable:
 *
 *  @li Grid dimensions:
 *      A classic Connect 4 game is limited to a six (6) by seven (7) grid. 
 *      Some classic variations include other grid dimensions. With the cXbase 
 *      library, you can make grids from the classic 6 by 7 size all the way to 
 *      an outrageous sixty-four(64) by 64 size.
 *
 *  @li Number of players:
 *      Why limit yourself to playing with only one opponent when you can play 
 *      with 8?
 *
 *  @li Disc color:
 *      Colors are only limited to your imagination! They can also easily be 
 *      printed to text mode for rapid console based game creation.
 *
 *  @li "In a row" value:
 *      With cXbase, the classic <em> four in a row </em> can now be rebaptized 
 *      the <em> X in a row </em>. you can play from two(2) to sixty-four(64) 
 *      in a row.
 *
 * If you need even larger sizes, all hope is not lost! the cXbase library 
 * is made available as free software. You can easily recompile it 
 * to fit your needs, however tests are not always designed to check these 
 * dimensions.
