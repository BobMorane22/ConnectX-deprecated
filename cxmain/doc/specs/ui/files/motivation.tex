This document is the GUI specification for \ttt{Connect X}, a scallable
Four-in-a-row software. It is intended to inform developpers on the required
GUI components needed to allow users to use the program effectively. It is
expected of any developper working on the core \ttt{Connect X} application
GUI layer to make sure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item that any GUI developpement is done according to the specification;
    \item that any piece of GUI added to the project is first documented here.
\end{enumerate}

Also note that this specification only applies for GUI developpement and for
the core \ttt{Connect X} application. If you are working on an internal piece
of software (a plugin, for example), please refer to the specification for that
particular project.
