% Packages descriptions:
\newcommand{\cxinvDescription}{Utilities to check that some system conditions
are respected. These utilities include various assertions macros, such a
basic assertion, preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and so on.}

\newcommand{\cxmathDescription}{Mathematical tools are stored in this package.
They include, points, vectors and many operations on these. Most of the tools
are generic.}

\newcommand{\cxutilDescription}{General utilities that either have no place in
any other packages. These often include very basic utilities, such as the
\ttt{narrow\_cast} function, which has no logical binding to any other package.}

\newcommand{\cxcmdDescription}{Regroups everything that is nedded to create
command objects, from a command interface to an undo stack. Note that the
concrete commands themselves are not created here. This package only handles
the abstract command utilities.}

\newcommand{\cxbaseDescription}{Contains all the buisness rules. In other words,
every piece of logic \textit{directly} related to a \connectx game is
in this package. It is the core of the application.}

\newcommand{\cxosDescription}{Contains abstractions over the operating system.}

\newcommand{\cxlogDescription}{Regroups logging utilities.}

\newcommand{\cxguiDescription}{Contains reusable GUI components (i.e, components
that could be reused in another application entirely). No \connectx GUI
components should reside in this package.}

\newcommand{\cxexecDescription}{All \connectx specific code is located here.
This package is the least reusable of all.}


Every \connectx package is described here:
