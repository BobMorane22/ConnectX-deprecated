\section{\texttt{class} vs \texttt{struct}}
A \texttt{struct} should be defined only when the data members that are 
considered form a data aglomeration without specific behaviour. For example, 
the following data collection is only a way to structure two \texttt{double}s 
but follow no specific behaviour and should be defined inside a \texttt{struct}:

\includecode{\varClassStructSnippets struct.cpp}

In the other hand, the following data agglomeration holds a specific behaviour 
-- a way to calculate its length:

\includecode{\varClassStructSnippets class.cpp}

and therefore should be defined inside a \texttt{class}. Note that 
\texttt{struct}s can sometimes hold constructors and methods. Usually, the 
content of a \texttt{struct} should be completely public and focus should 
be put on the data, not the behaviour.

\section{Access qualifiers}
When thinking about access qualifiers, the principle of least privilege should 
be applied. This principle states that (from Wikipedia):

\begin{quote}
  Every module must be able to access only the information and 
  resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose.
  \cite{noauthor_principle_2016}
\end{quote}


\section{Inheritance}
Single inheritance is encouraged, multiple inheritance is discouraged other 
than for interface implementation. Consider the following classes and 
interfaces:

\includecode{\varClassStructSnippets baseClass.cpp}

The \texttt{Foo} and \texttt{Waldo} classes are regular classes and should be 
inherited one at a time (even if the class is abstract, but contains some 
implementation--that is, it is not an interface). In the other hand, both 
classes \texttt{IBar} and \texttt{IBaz} are interfaces an can be inherited 
simultaneously. For example:

\includecode{\varClassStructSnippets inheritance.cpp}

Unless you really know what you are doing, all inheritance should be 
\ttt{public}.
