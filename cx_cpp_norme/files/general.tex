\section{C++11 is the default}
Throughout this document, you will notice that C++11 is used whenever possible. 
This same behaviour is expected from any programmer for the \texttt{cXbase} 
project. C++11 is becoming the new standard in the industry and it is important 
to create as modern a codebase as possible.

For now, C++14 and C++17 features are not to be used (unless there is no 
confortable way around it). When C++17 will become the new standard (that is,
it will ship with most compilers), it will be possible to use its features.


\section{Meaningful names}
Try to produce selft-documenting code which requires a minimum analysis from 
the reader. In a perfect world, names given to variables, functions and so on 
should never add to the analysis a user must perform while reading the code. 
Names should be clear and unambiguous. For example:

\includecode{\generalSnippets meaningfulNames.cpp}

Don't fear long names, as long as they are clear!


\section{Source code organization}

The source code should always be organized in multiple files.

\subsection{Classes and structs}
A header file (with the extention \texttt{.h} named after the class it defines. 
This header file contains the class definition but not its implementation. The 
implementation should be in a source file named after the class it implements 
with a \texttt{.cpp} extension.

\subsection{Templates}
Template classes need to have the method definitions inside the header file. To 
keep declaration and implementation separated, do the following:

\includecode{\generalSnippets fileOrganization.cpp}

Keep \textbf{one and only one} class, struct or template should be defined 
in a given pair of files. Finally, include header guards for each header file 
created. For example, for a header file containing the declaration of a class 
\texttt{Foo}:

\includecode{\generalSnippets headerGuards.cpp}

\section{Language and characters}
To avoid encoding issues, always use English ans ASCII characters either in 
your programming or your commenting.

\textbf{IMPORTANT:} tab characters should be replaced by four (4) space 
characters. Tab characters may be interpreted differently by different 
applications and therefore are a source of ambiguity which should be eleminated.
